designed to be access by many people.

man command to see the manual.

cd 
pwd 
cd ..

whereis
whoami
cal
date
time
mkdir
rmdir
rm 
touch
history
cat

vim is a editor 

Permission 
Linux was designed to allow many users to access single system at the same time.
also files need to be protected.


Permissions are of 3 types
